# Tic-tac-Toe-game
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. It allows two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first to place three of their marks (either "X" or "O") horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game provides a user-friendly interface for players to take turns and keeps track of the game state, announcing the winner or a draw when appropriate. The code is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It also includes a restart button, which restarts the game when clicked. Anathor feature of the game is that, all the cells are disabled when a winner is declared or the game is a tie.
