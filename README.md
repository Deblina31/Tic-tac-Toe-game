# Tic-tac-Toe-game
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. It allows two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid. The game provides a user-friendly interface for players to take turns and keeps track of the game state, announcing the winner or a draw when appropriate.
